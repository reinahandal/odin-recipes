    <h2>"No soup for you!"</h2>
    <p>Jerry, George and Elaine go out to a new soup stand Kramer has been raving about; its owner is referred to as the "Soup Nazi" due to his temperament and insistence on a strict manner of behavior while ordering. Jerry explains the procedure for ordering which George accepts, but Elaine rejects.</p>
    <p>When Jerry and George get to the soup stand, George follows the procedure but notices that he did not get any bread with his soup order. Jerry tells him, “Just forget it. Let it go.” George doesn't listen, however, and his soup is confiscated by the cashier. The Soup Nazi yells at him, “NO SOUP FOR YOU!”</p>
